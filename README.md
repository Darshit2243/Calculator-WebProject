# Calculator-WebProject
 I developed a simple and easy-to-use calculator webpage that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is also suitable for those who want to learn how to build a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
